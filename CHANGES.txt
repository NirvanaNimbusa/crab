0.3.0, 2013-03-28

    - Empty job output is no longer stored.
    - JavaScript uses RegExp instead of replace with 'g' option to avoid
      problems with browsers which do not support it.
    - Two new status codes have been added: 'CLEARED' and 'ALREADYRUNNING'.
    - The web interface now provides an option to clear the status of
      a job, returning it to a green color on the dashboard by inserting a
      'CLEARED' event.
    - Added a basic pidfile module which crabsh can use to detect that a job
      is already running and send an 'ALREADYRUNNING' status instead of
      starting it again.
    - Improved parsing of CRAB variables with the intention that crabsh
      and crabd both consisently combine variables from the environment
      with those specified at the start of a job command line.
    - CRABIGNORE now prevents crabsh reporting the status of a job.
    - PyRSS2Gen is now an optional dependency, and if it is not present,
      the RSS button will not be shown.

0.2.0, 2012-10-17

    - Minor update to the database schema to replace confusing names.
      (A corresponding SQLite update script is provided in the util directory.)
    - Job output and raw crontabs can now optionally be saved in files instead
      of in the database.
    - The base URL used in email notifications and the RSS feed is now
      configurable.
    - Added history navigation to the job pages.
    - Headings on the dashboard page can be clicked to sort the table.
